# Railway Network Optimization Project

A Data Structures & Algorithms-based project to simulate and optimize railway network operations including network design and route planning.

---

## 📌 Features

### 🔹 Design your network
- **Design** network using simple UI to add station and tracks between them.


### 🔹 Path Optimization
- **Shortest Path** between two stations using Dijkstra’s or BFS.
- **Path Covering Maximum Nodes** to explore more stops on a journey.
- **Minimum Node Path** for the fastest possible route with the least stations.
- **All Possible Paths** for analyzing travel flexibility.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++ / Python (based on DSA)
- **Graph Algorithms:** Dijkstra’s, DFS, BFS, 
- **Data Structures:** Adjacency List
